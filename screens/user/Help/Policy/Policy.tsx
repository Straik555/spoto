          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems [and our mobile
          applications] include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you
          can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about
          your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform
          technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has
          been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
          signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
          choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
          adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about
          that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.
